			<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
			<p id="phead"> <u>Collaboration</u></p>
			<p id="pbody">
			Collaboration on assignments, in class labs and homeworks, IS encouraged.  However, what you hand in must be in your own writing/typing.  Good scholarship requires that all collaborations must be acknowledged.  Thus, if you collaborate on the solution of the problem set, we expect that you list your collaborators at the top of the page.  Collaboration on in-class evaluations (quizzes, mid-terms, and the final exams) is, of course, a violation.  This includes a discussion of questions on a quiz, midterm, or final with students from sections that has not yet taken the evaluation. </p>
			<p id="phead"> <u>Plagiarism</u></p>
			<p id="pbody">
				If you consult any outside sources when doing your work, you are expect to further document these sources.  Give credit where credit is due.  Plagiarism will not be tolerated. </p>
			<p id="pbody">
			<b><u>All handed in homework should state at the top any assistance with debugging and programming, as well as citations of any program segments copied from a website. </p></b></u>

			<p id="phead"> <u>Seeking Help</u></p>
			<p id="pbody">
			Language classes are cumulative; don’t fall behind.  Ask for assistance from your fellow students or from the instructor, especially if you find yourself struggling.  But remember in the end, programming classes are like skill building math classes.  Either you know how to do them or not.  No amount of watching others or the instructor program or debug it will suffice for you to build these skills.  Only your hard work to work through them will build your skills.  It is a lot of work to build these skills, but data skills are highly valuable in the job market in the modern digital world, so it will be well worth your effort.  Furthermore, once you learn to think in this manner, it’s not something you forget.</p>

			<p id="phead"> <u>Elegance</u></p>
			<p id="pbody">
			There is always more than one way to say something, but some ways will be more “elegant” than others.  You will learn to recognize elegant expressions as you become more familiar with a language and use the elegant idioms as you become more skilled.</p>

			<p id="phead"> <u>Academic Integrity Statement and Policy</u> </p>
			<p id="pbody">
				Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and deception and is an educational objective of this institution. Students are expected to adhere to all TAMUS, TAMU, HSC, and School policies regarding academic integrity and classroom conduct. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used, or tampering with the academic work of another student. Individuals found guilty of academic dishonesty may be dismissed from the degree program, and at a minimum will receive an F for the course. It is the student’s responsibility to have a clear understanding of how to reference other individuals’ work, as well as having a clear understanding in general as to the various aspects of academic dishonesty. A tutorial on this issue is available at: <a href = "http://srph.tamhsc.edu/academic-affairs/academic-integrity.html" target = "_balnk"> http://srph.tamhsc.edu/academic-affairs/academic-integrity.html</a>.
