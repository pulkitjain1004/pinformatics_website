			<p>The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) has awarded Texas A&amp;M University with a Tier I award in the amount of $15,000 for a 9-month period. Tier I awards fund the building of the community and capacity necessary to later develop a patient-centered comparative effectiveness research project.&nbsp; The project is awarded to Mark Lawley of the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department to examine Diabetes Education and Wellness Through Faith-based Organizations (FBOs) in Texas.&nbsp; Only 17% of proposals submitted were selected for PCORI’s Tier I award.</p>
<p>Diabetes is a chronic disease requiring behavior modification and lifestyle changes to manage the disease. Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death in the U.S. and costs $245 billion per year.&nbsp; Texas is the 5th leading state in diabetes prevalence.&nbsp; It is difficult to effectively control the fast growing trend in diabetes prevalence in Texas since risk factors are very prevalent. For example, about 1 of 3 adults in Texas are obese, and 2 of 3 are either overweight or obese.&nbsp; Also, more than 50% of adults in Texas are not physically active and about 3 of 4 adults have fewer than 5 servings of fruits and vegetables each day.</p>
<p>Fortunately, proper management reduces the risk of disease progression and complications.&nbsp; Often, disease management is taught through diabetes education and wellness classes.&nbsp; FBOs describe organizations or programs associated with a religious congregation and account for a variety of religious backgrounds (e.g., Christian, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, etc.).&nbsp; Some FBOs have successfully partnered with health promotion programs to provide preventative health services to at-risk populations with chronic diseases.&nbsp; FBOs have regular access to a captive adult audience of patients and volunteers and they typically have strong community credibility. Therefore, FBOs will be of central importance in facilitating diabetes management and improving population health.</p>
<p>There are three main thrusts to be executed for this project: partnership development, communication structure, and leadership structure.&nbsp; For partnership development, the goal is to build a partnership network of more than 40 researchers, diabetes educators, clinicians, patients, and FBOs who are interested in comparing the awareness, behavior modification, and disease-management success of patient populations who receive diabetes education and wellness from traditional sources vs. FBOs.&nbsp;&nbsp; For communication, the team will utilize a listserv and is currently in the process of developing a website for the partnership network. Finally, for leadership development, the team will form an internal governance structure to facilitate discussions about using FBOs for diabetes education and wellness.</p>
<p>The partnership team initially consists of three researchers (Mark Lawley, Hye-Chung Kum, Michelle Alvarado) from Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) and the President (Charles Bell) of the Diabetes Health and Wellness Institute (DHWI) at Juanita J. Craft Recreation Center.&nbsp; Mark Lawley, Ph.D., P.E., (PI) is the TEES Research and One Health Professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering and Biomedical Engineering. Hye-Chung Kum, Ph.D., MSW (Co-PI) is an associate professor of Health Policy and Management at the School of Rural Public Health in the Texas A&amp;M Health Science Center. Michelle Alvarado, PhD, (Project Lead) is a postdoctoral research associate in Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at Texas A&amp;M University.</p>
<p>PCORI’s mission is to help people make informed healthcare decisions, and improve healthcare delivery and its outcomes, by producing and promoting high-integrity, evidence-based information that comes from research guided by patients, caregivers, and the broader healthcare community.&nbsp; This is the second year PCORI has funded Tier I awards in their “Pipeline to Proposal” process.&nbsp; The Pipeline to proposal is a 3-tier process aimed to build a national community of patients, stakeholders, and researchers who have the expertise and passion to participate in patient-centered outcomes research that lead to high-quality research proposals. Upon successful completion of PCORI’s Tier I award, projects are eligible to advance to Tier II ($25,000 for 12 months) for further development of the partnerships.&nbsp; This year, 27 of 30 projects advanced from Tier I to Tier II.&nbsp; Another competitive process is required to receive a PCORI Tier III ($50,000 for 12 months) award whose purpose is to develop high quality research proposals.</p>

<p>“The incidence of type II diabetes is increasingly prevalent in the Texas population.&nbsp; We feel that utilizing FBOs as a means of communicating diabetes education and wellness can be effective in reducing this prevalence.&nbsp; The PCORI funding will be instrumental in allowing us to develop the partnerships necessary to pursue this research idea.”<br>
