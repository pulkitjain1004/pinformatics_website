			<p id="phead"> <u> INSTRUCTOR</u> </p>
			<p id="pbody">
				Course Time: Tuesdays, 9 am to 12 pm <br />
				Location: SPH Classroom Building 119 (Computer Lab)

				You are required to check the class website regularly (at least three times a week) as it will have important class announcements.
			</p>
			<p id="phead"><u> COURSE DESCRIPTION</u></p>
			<p id="pbody">
				Data science is the systematic study of digital data using scientific techniques of observation, theory development, systematic analysis, hypothesis testing, and rigorous validation.  Data scientists are those that can apply data science to continuously changing deluge of digital raw data that are often inconsistent and erroneous to extract and deliver actionable knowledge in a timely manner.  Data scientists are interdisciplinary scientists who have a combination of skills in statistics and data management (to turn raw data into information), programming (to build the data pipeline and infrastructure for efficient processing of raw data into information), and domain expertise (to (a) correctly interpret the data, information, and results, (b) know what information is required, and (c) how accurate it needs to be).  <br /> <br />

				The primary purpose of this course is to apply data science to health data for health services research in order to improve the three core dimensions in healthcare: (1) improve quality, (2) reduce costs, and (3) improve access.

				This course requires substantial programming, submission of programming assignments bi-weekly, a midterm, and completion of a final project. Each student is required to select and COMMIT TO a statistical package (SAS or STATA) they will focus on learning during the class by the start of second class.  Your first assignment is to email Dr. Kum which package you will commit to for the class NO LATER THAN Jan 26th, 2014 (Sunday before the second class). This information will be used to set up groups for the in class lab session starting the second class.

				Student grades will be based on: <br />
				[Homework Assignments (6 * 8 points each)]............[48] points [or 48%] <br />
				[Midterm Exam]..........................................................[20] points [or 20%] <br />
				[Final Project].............................................................[32] points [or 32%]

			<p id="pbody">	
			There will be a homework assignment due every other week. Homework assignments and related materials will be made available on the course website.  I strongly advise students to begin to work on their homework assignments soon after they are assigned, so that if they need help from the instructor they have time to ask and receive assistance.  There will be six (6) regular HW assignments during the semester. The overall weight of the HW assignments on the computation of the final course grade is 48%, HALF the grade. <br />
			All assignments are due at 11:59pm the day before the class they are due.

			<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
			<p id="phead"> <u>Collaboration</u></p>
			<p id="pbody">
			Collaboration on assignments, in class labs and homeworks, IS encouraged.  However, what you hand in must be in your own writing/typing.  Good scholarship requires that all collaborations must be acknowledged.  Thus, if you collaborate on the solution of the problem set, we expect that you list your collaborators at the top of the page.  Collaboration on in-class evaluations (quizzes, mid-terms, and the final exams) is, of course, a violation.  This includes a discussion of questions on a quiz, midterm, or final with students from sections that has not yet taken the evaluation. </p>
			<p id="phead"> <u>Plagiarism</u></p>
			<p id="pbody">
				If you consult any outside sources when doing your work, you are expect to further document these sources.  Give credit where credit is due.  Plagiarism will not be tolerated. </p>
			<p id="pbody">
			<b><u>All handed in homework should state at the top any assistance with debugging and programming, as well as citations of any program segments copied from a website. </p></b></u>

			<p id="phead"> <u>Seeking Help</u></p>
			<p id="pbody">
			Language classes are cumulative; don’t fall behind.  Ask for assistance from your fellow students or from the instructor, especially if you find yourself struggling.  But remember in the end, programming classes are like skill building math classes.  Either you know how to do them or not.  No amount of watching others or the instructor program or debug it will suffice for you to build these skills.  Only your hard work to work through them will build your skills.  It is a lot of work to build these skills, but data skills are highly valuable in the job market in the modern digital world, so it will be well worth your effort.  Furthermore, once you learn to think in this manner, it’s not something you forget.</p>

			<p id="phead"> <u>Elegance</u></p>
			<p id="pbody">
			There is always more than one way to say something, but some ways will be more “elegant” than others.  You will learn to recognize elegant expressions as you become more familiar with a language and use the elegant idioms as you become more skilled.</p>

			<p id="pbody">
				Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and deception and is an educational objective of this institution. Students are expected to adhere to all TAMUS, TAMU, HSC, and School policies regarding academic integrity and classroom conduct. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used, or tampering with the academic work of another student. Individuals found guilty of academic dishonesty may be dismissed from the degree program, and at a minimum will receive an F for the course. It is the student’s responsibility to have a clear understanding of how to reference other individuals’ work, as well as having a clear understanding in general as to the various aspects of academic dishonesty. A tutorial on this issue is available at: <a href = "http://srph.tamhsc.edu/academic-affairs/academic-integrity.html" target = "_balnk"> http://srph.tamhsc.edu/academic-affairs/academic-integrity.html</a>.
