				<h1>Population Informatics Research Group</h1>	
				<p class="lead"></p>
				<h2>Join Us</h2>
				<p>We are looking for highly motivated graduate students and undergraduate students in computer science to work in the area of Data Science with Health Data.</p>
				<h2>Position 0: TAMU Graduate Students in Computer Science</h2>
				<p>If you are interested in a MS thesis or doctoral dissertation with the group, email Dr. Kum the following</p>
				<ul>
					<li>your list of classes, instructor, and grades from TAMU</li>
					<li>a short description of what in this field you are interested in</li>
				</ul>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<h2>Position 1: TAMU Graduate Students in Computer Science</h2>
				<p><em><strong><span>This position has been filled for Spring 2015. Please check again another semester.</span></strong></em></p>
				<p>Are you <strong>a highly motivated independent student</strong> looking for a chance to get involved with exciting research in the emerging field of data science? Do you learn by actually working on real problems?&nbsp; Would you like to become an expert SAS programmer (prior knowledge not required, but desire to learn required.&nbsp; Similar to R.)? Would you like to get a job in the health informatics field? There is an opening for a chance to work on exciting research in data intensive health problems.</p>
				<h3>Who are we</h3>
				<p>The <strong>Population Informatics Research Group</strong> applies informatics, data science, and computational methods to the increasingly large digital traces available to advance public health, social science, and population research. This research group is a joint effort between UNC-CH and Texas A&amp;M.&nbsp; Dr. Kum, the lead, is a data scientist with training in both computer science and Health and has worked with many computer science students to do research on health informatics problems. For more information poke around other sections of this website.</p>
				<h3>Job Description</h3>
				<p>Learn SAS (training is part of the job), a very marketable programming skill and one of the main technologies used in the data science field, and <strong>design and build data pipelines for processing raw health data to information</strong>.</p>
				<h3>Qualifications</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Good understanding of data structures, algorithms, software engineering principles</li>
					<li>Good programmer (in any language): mainly good programming skills</li>
					<li>Works independently, motivated to learn, and curious (when you have a question, there is an itch until you answer it)</li>
					<li>Good communication skills and time management</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>How to apply</h3>
				<p>We will be receiving applications until the position is filled.<br>
				Start date is no later than January 22nd with possibility to start immediately.<br>
				Eligible for instate tuition rate benefits. &nbsp;Possibility for a thesis topic.</p>
				<p>If you are interested in our research, please email the following materials to Dr. Hye-Chung Kum directly: kum (at) tamhsc (dot) edu</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Body of email
						<ul>
						<li>Undergraduate overall GPA &amp; CS major GPA</li>
						<li>Undergraduate list of CS classes you took, term you took it, instructor name (if at TAMU), and grade</li>
						<li>Undergraduate list of statistics classes you took, term you took it, instructor name (if at TAMU), and grade</li>
						<li>graduate list of CS classes you took, term you took it, instructor name (if at TAMU), and grade</li>
						<li>If you have any undergraduate or graduate classes that you think pertain to health, policy, or management, list those.</li>
						<li>Very briefly: what would you like to get out of the RA experience</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Attach
						<ul>
						<li>CV</li>
						<li>Transcript (unofficial is ok)</li>
